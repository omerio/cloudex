        </h3>
        <p>
          You have a computational job which can be broken down into a sequence of tasks, some of which are memory intesive, others are CPU intensive or both. Other tasks are neither memory nor CPU intensive, but are used for forking and joining work. CloudEx executes such a job on the cloud by acquiring various worker VMs with different specification to execute the tasks and deletes them once the job is done. You can statically declare the VM specification to execute each task or drive it dynamically during the job execution. The following two cloud features makes it possible for CloudEx to dynamically acquire heterogeneous and ephemeral cloud-based clusters:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Short VM startup time</strong> - this enables CloudEx to dynamically acquire VMs during job execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Per-minute billing</strong> - this enables CloudEx to delete the VMs once the job is done, without incurring unecessary cost.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is CloudEx?
        </h3>

        <p>
          CloudEx is a framework for executing jobs on cloud virtual machines. CloudEx uses a coordinator component to facilitate the excecution of jobs in the cloud. The coordinator can be run locally, on a VM or a remote server. The coordinator component acquires worker VMs &mdash; called processors &mdash; to execute a job, once the job is done the coordinator deletes these processors. Jobs are defined as a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_parallel_(computing)">embarrassingly parallel</a> tasks. Each task can be executed by the coordinator or multiple (1 to n) processors. CloudEx provides an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem">Bin Packing algorithm</a> that users can use to distribute the workload for processor tasks. Each processor task can define the specification (disk, memory and CPU cores) of the VM on which it should be executed. The number and the specification of the processors that execute each task can either be defined statically in the job JSON definition or driven dynamically during the job execution.

        <p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and
            switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

        </h3>

        <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static
            site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.
